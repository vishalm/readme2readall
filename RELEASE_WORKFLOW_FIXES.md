# Release Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Package Version Conflict (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: The package version 1.0.3 already existed on Test PyPI, causing upload failures.

**Solution**: 
- Updated version from `1.0.3` to `1.0.4` in both `pyproject.toml` and `readme2word/__init__.py`
- This ensures a unique version that doesn't conflict with existing packages

### 2. Trusted Publishing Warnings
**Problem**: GitHub Actions was showing warnings about Trusted Publishing being disabled due to explicit password usage.

**Solution**:
- Added `attestations: false` to both Test PyPI and PyPI publishing steps
- Added `verbose: true` for better debugging output
- This removes the warnings while maintaining current authentication method

### 3. License Format Deprecation
**Problem**: The license was using deprecated table format causing setuptools warnings.

**Solution**:
- Changed from `license = {text = "MIT"}` to modern SPDX format
- Removed deprecated license classifier from classifiers list
- This eliminates deprecation warnings during build

### 4. Insufficient Error Handling
**Problem**: Limited debugging information when uploads failed.

**Solution**:
- Added `verbose: true` to PyPI publishing actions
- Added `--strict` flag to twine check
- Added package listing steps to show what's being uploaded
- Enhanced error messages with common troubleshooting tips

### 5. Test PyPI Installation Reliability
**Problem**: Installation tests sometimes failed due to package propagation delays.

**Solution**:
- Increased wait time from 30 to 60 seconds
- Added retry logic with 3 attempts and 30-second intervals
- This improves reliability of installation testing

### 6. Release Notes Generation
**Problem**: Basic release notes without proper formatting.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced changelog extraction logic
- Added fallback content for missing changelog entries
- Added debug output to show generated release notes
- Improved version detection with debug output

## Updated Release Workflow Features

### Enhanced Build Process
- Strict package validation with `twine check --strict`
- Package listing for transparency
- Better artifact management

### Improved Publishing
- Verbose output for debugging
- Disabled attestations to avoid warnings
- Better error handling and reporting

### Robust Testing
- Retry logic for Test PyPI installation
- Extended wait times for package propagation
- Multiple installation attempts

### Better Notifications
- Enhanced success messages with all relevant URLs
- Detailed failure messages with troubleshooting tips
- Common issue identification

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Local Build Test**: ✅ Passed
   ```bash
   python -m build --wheel --sdist
   twine check dist/readme2word_converter_vm-1.0.4*
   ```

2. **Version Consistency**: ✅ Verified
   - `pyproject.toml`: 1.0.4
   - `readme2word/__init__.py`: 1.0.4
   - Built packages: 1.0.4

3. **Package Validation**: ✅ Passed
   - Both wheel and source distribution pass twine checks
   - No validation errors or warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Release Workflow**:
   - Create a new git tag: `git tag v1.0.4`
   - Push the tag: `git push origin v1.0.4`
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow

2. **Alternative Testing**:
   - Use manual workflow dispatch to test without creating tags
   - Verify Test PyPI upload works before production

3. **Monitor Results**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for any remaining issues
   - Verify package appears on Test PyPI and PyPI
   - Test installation from both repositories

## Trusted Publishing (Future Enhancement)

The warnings suggest setting up Trusted Publishing for better security:
- Visit: https://test.pypi.org/manage/project/readme2word-converter-vm/settings/publishing/
- Configure GitHub Actions as a trusted publisher
- Remove API tokens and use OIDC authentication
- This eliminates the need for API tokens and improves security

## Summary

All identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Version conflict resolved (1.0.3 → 1.0.4)
- ✅ License format modernized
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and debugging
- ✅ Improved reliability with retry logic
- ✅ Better release notes generation
- ✅ Package validation passes

The release workflow should now work reliably for publishing to both Test PyPI and production PyPI.
